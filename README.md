There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## A resource storage service ##

## For those who need to revisit resources for more information or clarification. ##

## Summary ##
  re:Member is a web-based resource storage platform for keeping track of things you have read, seen, or heard. For every time you have said "oh I read about that but I can't remember what it was" re:Member will let you revisit a past resource to brush up. Simply post a link with a short description of what you learned, and optionally some categories, and re:Member will later allow you to review the information.

## Problem ##
  It can be frustrating when you know you've learned something about a certain topic only to forget exactly what it was that you learned. The human memory works by association, rather than as a raw-format data storage medium. As such, it can be easy to say "I read an article about Saturn's rings the other day" but very hard to recite the information presented in the resource. On top of that, you can't exactly search google for "that saturn article I read last week" and get the article back for a refresher. re:Member aims to solve this.

## Solution ##
  By storing resources you've already consumed with helpful information attached, re:Member allows you to do what you're good at: associative memory. re:Member takes care of the raw data storage for you, so all you have to do is think "what was it that I read about saturn recently?" search up the keyword "Saturn" and you can easily find any relevant resource for easy revisiting.

## How to Get Started ##
  Simply visit the application and begin storing resources. Then, later, when you realize you've forgotten some important piece of information, come back to re:Member. Use the associative data you assigned to quickly direct your research to the resource you don't fully remember.
